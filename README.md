# Relational-Databases-and-SQL

This is the "Databases: Relational-Databases-and-SQL" course offered by Stanford on edx:
https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YDB-SQL0001+2T2020/home

This Course had 6 six sets of assignments consisting of 41 queries and 2 schemas. My work on the assignments are provided in two different files, each of which related to one of the schemas. 

Note that all these queries have resulted into a correct answer by the auto grading system of the course. These queries are run in "SQLITE" and although the majority work on other database management systems, all may not work. For example, "EXCEPT" is a valid clause in sqlite but not in "MYSQL" and thus, the queries containing this clause will have to be modified for execution using "MYSQL".

PS: please solve the assignments before looking at the answers. Moreover, there are multiple queries which result into the same relations, thus, my answers are not unique (and surely not the most efficient!).
